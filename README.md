## Hadoop log processor

The idea behind this project is to learn more about the basics of Hadoop.

The **log-generator** module will be producing the "big data", which will be processed later one with a Map-Reduce function.

The **log-processor** module will be processing the generated data, using Map-Reduce functions.

_NB! The code style is based on the defensive programming paradigm / tiger style programming, assuring the correctness of the application during the different stages._
